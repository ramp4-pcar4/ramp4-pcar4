# Navigation Controls

Navigation controls are used for changing the viewing extent of the map.

The following navigation controls can be found in the bottom right corner of the map:

|Symbol|Name|Key Binding|Description|
|----|----|----|----|
|![](navigation/zoomin.png)| Zoom in | Plus (+) | Zoom in one level on the map to see more detailed content |
|![](navigation/zoomout.png)| Zoom out | Minus (-) | Zoom out one level on the map to see less detailed content  |
|![](navigation/fullscreen.png)| Fullscreen | | Full screen presents map content using the entire page. Full screen option is only available when the map is embedded into another page  |
|![](navigation/help.png)| Help | | Open the help panel |
|![](navigation/home.png)| Home | | Zoom and pan map such that initial extent is visible |
|![](navigation/basemaps.png)| Basemap | | Opens the basemap selection panel |

You can also pan the map by using your left, right, up and down arrow keys, or by click-holding on the map and dragging. Holding CTRL and using the mouse scroll wheel while hovering over the map will zoom the map in/out.

If you are panning the map using arrow keys, you can press SHIFT or CTRL to pan the map faster or slower (respectively).

Note that the map __must be__ focused for key binding to work.
