// This exists for stuff that needs to be able to run without an instance.
// Mainly done to prevent circular reference errors. A bit sketchy as it
// splits files across folders that would normally be grouped together.
// Brave people can revist and attempt to make nicer without
// triggering circular refs (they appear in the build version,
// serve version is usually fine)
